This is a filament wrapper for unlayer editor with custom select field with unlayer templates.


## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require InfinityXTech/filament-unlayer
```

Create a cast within your model:

```php
protected $casts = [
   'content' => 'array',
];
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="filament-unlayer-config"
```

Optionally, you can publish the views using

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="filament-unlayer-views"
```

## Usage

As any other filament form field:

```php
Unlayer::make('content')->required()
```

In case you want to select unlayer templates you can use:

```php
SelectTemplate::make('template'),
Unlayer::make('content')->required()
```

By default the Unlayer field name should `content` but if you need to change it you will need to update `SelectTemplate`:

```php
SelectTemplate::make('template')
    ->afterStateUpdated(fn (string $operation, $state, Forms\Set $set)
        => $set('description', InfinityXTech\FilamentUnlayer\Services\GetTemplates::find($state))
    ),
Unlayer::make('description')->required()
```

You can still chain other methods on these since:

`SelectTemplate` is extending filament `Select` field.

`Unlayer` is extending filament `Field` class.
